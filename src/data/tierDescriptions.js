  'The Bleh': 'Forgettable seasons that are neither particularly good nor bad. Everything is decent but nothing really stands out.',
  'The Shit Show Seasons': "It's not even that these seasons are bad. They're just a mess. To the point where what makes the season a mess seriously takes away from the enjoyment of the season.",
  'Replacement Level Survivor': 'These are very enjoyable seasons of Survivor. If you asked me what average Survivor was like I would point to these seasons.',
  'The New Era Malaise': 'Enjoyable seasons for the most part. Things to like about each. Things to dislike about each. However, these seasons lack individual identities. They blur together as the aesthetic of the show is flattened in the "New Era" with the same location and shorter seasons overstuffed with advantages and heavily overcasted with Survivor "superfans" who individually are dynamic characters and players but collectively feels stale.',
  'Unwatchable': 'I wish these seasons didn\'t exist.',
  'Impossible to Rank': 'Early seasons that established the game but are so different from modern Survivor that they defy conventional ranking.',
  'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly': 'These seasons have somethings I absolutely love about them but also somethings I could have done without and somethings that really rubbed me the wrong way.',
  'Cheers Survivor': "Like the bar in the show \"Cheers\", the place you go where everyone knows your name. It is just fun to hang out there and it is fun to hang out with these seasons. They're just a good time.",
  'Hitting on All Cylinders': 'These seasons have got everything going for them and are all around fun to watch.',
  'Next Level Survivor': 'These are great seasons of Survivor that have that little extra something to take them to the next level.',
  'The Pantheon': 'The elite tier of Survivor seasons. These represent the absolute pinnacle of what makes Survivor great.'
