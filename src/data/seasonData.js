If I were to make my dream cast of any 20 Survivor players around 10 of those players played on this season. It is a who's who of Survivor's legend. And let me tell you, those legends came to play. There's historically great gameplay. There's historically bad gameplay. All of it is entertaining. It is simply Survivor at its best."

The strategy and gameplay is a wild and fun ride."

It's a very strong cast with a couple of borderline Survivor legends and one of my all-time favorite players. But really, it's a season defined by its story. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say anything more than that. I've seen this season described as \"dark\" before which I suppose is true in some regard but I don't think that is the right way to describe it. To me the stakes just seem higher in Palau, in an almost Shakespearean way, and it makes for some tense and fascinating viewing."

Solid strategy, a great cast including likeable heroes and a detestable villain, and more than its fair share of big moments. But it is the story that takes it to the next level. It is not one major story throughout the season but rather a dozen and a half stories that play out throughout the season in cascading fashion where as one story comes to a conclusion after a couple episodes another storyline begins all while there are several great season long storylines."

It is a great premise for a season made even better by the fact that the players were voted in by fans so there are almost no duds in the cast. Because all the players were voted in by fans they play incredibly hard to prove they deserve to be there and it leads to the most strategy heavy season ever. It takes a slight hit because the more complex strategy makes it harder for there to be a cohesive story to the season but it more than makes up for it in exciting gameplay."

I probably have this season a little higher than it should be because the winner is a personal favorite of mine.

Some of the twists are great and drive a lot of drama or add new wrinkles to the game while other twits are terrible and borderline game breaking."

Alliances split pretty much down tribal lines, trust and relationships are everything, and the tension of the season is driven largely by conflicts from camp life. I enjoyed it and it serves as a fitting end to that era of Survivor especially as it introduces the first hidden immunity idol to the game. It's a season whose reputation has also suffered as there are no returning players who were originally on Guatemala. Because of this none of its players reach Survivor legend status and the season can't serve as an interesting origin story for any of its players the way some other seasons can for its players that would go on to be Survivor legends."

It jumps from one thing to the next leaving us as the viewer without a clear picture of what the social and gameplay dynamics on the island actually are. It is also a season where production goes a little overboard with the advantages and twists to the point where production is almost inserting themselves into the game. All this leads to a couple favorite players going out in bizarre circumstances where you can't help but feel they were robbed. At the end, you just wish they waited longer to bring some of these players back where they had a more fully filled out cast where they could let the players shine rather than all the quirks and twists production comes up with."

To make things worse there is not a single fan that stands out. They might as well not even be there. Then on top of the lackluster cast you have some of the most awkward and uncomfortable moments in the history of the show. The only redeeming things about this season are you have a pretty good winner and there are a couple great moments at tribal council that help plant the seeds for the big move era of survivor that fully explodes a couple seasons later."
